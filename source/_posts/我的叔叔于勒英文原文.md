## My Uncle Jules —— Maupassant  

&emsp;&emsp;A white-haired old man begged us for alms. My companion, Joseph Davranche, gave him five francs. Noticing my surprised look, he said: 

&emsp;&emsp;That poor unfortunate reminds me of a story which I shall tell you, the memory of which continually pursues me. Here it is:  

&emsp;&emsp;My family, which came originally from Havre, was not rich. We just managed to make both ends meet. My father worked hard, came home late from the office, and earned very little. I had two sisters.

&emsp;&emsp;My mother suffered a good deal from our reduced circumstances, and she often had harsh words for her husband, veiled and sly reproaches. The poor man then made a gesture which used to distress me. He would pass his open hand over his forehead, as if to wipe away perspiration which did not exist, and he would answer nothing. I felt his helpless suffering. We economized on everything, and never would accept an invitation to dinner, so as not to have to return the courtesy. All our provisions were bought at bargain sales. My sisters made their own gowns, and long discussions would arise on the price of a piece of braid worth fifteen centimes a yard. Our meals usually consisted cf soup and beef, prepared with every kind of sauce.

&emsp;&emsp;They say it is wholesome and nourishing, but I should have preferred a change.

&emsp;&emsp;I used to go through terrible scenes on account of lost buttons and torn trousers.

&emsp;&emsp;Every Sunday, dressed in our best, we would take our walk along the breakwater. My father, in a frock coat, high hat and kid gloves, would offer his arm to my mother, decked out and beribboned like a ship on a holiday. My sisters, who were always ready first, would await the signal for leaving; but at the last minute some one always found a spot on my father's frock coat, and it had to be wiped away quickly with a rag moistened with benzine.

&emsp;&emsp;My father, in his shirt sleeves, his silk hat on his head, would await the completion of the operation, while my mother, putting on her spectacles, and taking off her gloves in order not to spoil them, would make haste.

&emsp;&emsp;Then we set out ceremoniously. My sisters marched on ahead, arm in arm. They were of marriageable age and had to be displayed. I walked on the left of my mother and my father on her right. I remember the pompous air of my poor parents in these Sunday walks, their stern expression, their stiff walk. They moved slowly, with a serious expression, their bodies straight, their legs stiff, as if something of extreme importance depended upon their appearance.

&emsp;&emsp;Every Sunday, when the big steamers were returning from unknown and distant countries, my father would invariably utter the same words:

&emsp;&emsp;‘What a surprise it would be if Jules were on that one! Eh?'

&emsp;&emsp;My Uncle Jules, my father's brother, was the only hope of the family, after being its only fear. I had heard about him since childhood, and it seemed to me that I should recognize him immediately, knowing as much about him as I did. I knew every detail of his life up to the day of his departure for America, although this period of his life was spoken of only in hushed tones.

&emsp;&emsp;It seems that he had led a bad life, that is to say, he had squandered a little money, which action, in a poor family, is one of the greatest crimes. With rich people a man who amuses himself only sows his wild oats. He is what is generally called a sport. But among needy families a boy who forces his parents to break into the capital becomes a good- for-nothing, a rascal, a scamp. And this distinction is just, although the action be the same, for consequences alone determine the seriousness of the act.

&emsp;&emsp;Well, Uncle Jules had visibly diminished the inheritance on which my father had counted, after he had swallowed his own to the last penny. Then, according to the custom of the times, he had been shipped off to America on a freighter going from Havre to New York.

&emsp;&emsp;"Once there, my uncle began to sell something or other, and he soon wrote that he was making a little money and that he soon hoped to be able to indemnify my father for the harm he had done him. This letter caused a profound emotion in the family. Jules, who up to that time had not been worth his salt, suddenly became a good man, a kind-hearted fellow, true and honest like all the Davranches.

&emsp;&emsp;One of the captains told us that he had rented a large shop and was doing an important business.

&emsp;&emsp;Two years later a second letter came, saying: 'My dear Philippe, I am writing to tell you not to worry about my health, which is excellent. Business is good. I leave to-morrow for a long trip to South America. I may be away for several years without sending you any news. If I shouldn't write, don't worry. When my fortune is made I shall return to Havre. I hope that it will not be too long and that we shall all live happily together . . . .'

&emsp;&emsp;This letter became the gospel of the family. It was read on the slightest provocation, and it was shown to everybody.

&emsp;&emsp;For ten years nothing was heard from Uncle Jules; but as time went on my father's hope grew, and my mother, also, often said:

&emsp;&emsp;‘When that good Jules is here, our position will be different. There is one who knew how to get along!'

&emsp;&emsp;And every Sunday, while watching the big steamers approaching from the horizon, pouring out a stream of smoke, my father would repeat his eternal question:

&emsp;&emsp;‘What a surprise it would be if Jules were on that one! Eh?'

&emsp;&emsp;We almost expected to see him waving his handkerchief and crying:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Hey! Philippe!'

&emsp;&emsp;Thousands of schemes had been planned on the strength of this expected return; we were even to buy a little house with my uncle's money --a little place in the country near Ingouville. In fact, I wouldn't swear that my father had not already begun negotiations.

&emsp;&emsp;The elder of my sisters was then twenty-eight, the other twenty-six. They were not yet married, and that was a great grief to every one.

&emsp;&emsp;At last a suitor presented himself for the younger one. He was a clerk, not rich, but honorable. I have always been morally certain that Uncle Jules' letter, which was shown him one evening, had swept away the young man's hesitation and definitely decided him.

&emsp;&emsp;He was accepted eagerly, and it was decided that after the wedding the whole family should take a trip to Jersey.

&emsp;&emsp;Jersey is the ideal trip for poor people. It is not far; one crosses a strip of sea in a steamer and lands on foreign soil, as this little island belongs to England. Thus, a Frenchman, with a two hours' sail, can observe a neighboring people at home and study their customs.

&emsp;&emsp;This trip to Jersey completely absorbed our ideas, was our sole anticipation, the constant thought of our minds.

&emsp;&emsp;At last we left. I see it as plainly as if it had happened yesterday. The boat was getting up steam against the quay at Granville; my father, bewildered, was superintending the loading of our three pieces of baggage; my mother, nervous, had taken the arm of my unmarried sister, who seemed lost since the departure of the other one, like the last chicken of a brood; behind us came the bride and groom, who always stayed behind, a thing that often made me turn round.

&emsp;&emsp;The whistle sounded. We got on board, and the vessel, leaving the breakwater, forged ahead through a sea as flat as a marble table. We watched the coast disappear in the distance, happy and proud, like all who do not travel much.

&emsp;&emsp;My father was swelling out his chest in the breeze, beneath his frock coat, which had that morning been very carefully cleaned; and he spread around him that odor of benzine which always made me recognize Sunday. Suddenly he noticed two elegantly dressed ladies to whom two gentlemen were offering oysters. An old, ragged sailor was opening them with his knife and passing them to the gentlemen, who would then offer them to the ladies. They ate them in a dainty manner, holding the shell on a fine handkerchief and advancing their mouths a little in order not to spot their dresses. Then they would drink the liquid with a rapid little motion and throw the shell overboard.

&emsp;&emsp;My father was probably pleased with this delicate manner of eating oysters on a moving ship. He considered it good form, refined, and, going up to my mother and sisters, he asked:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Would you like me to offer you some oysters?'

&emsp;&emsp;My mother hesitated on account of the expense, but my two sisters immediately accepted. My mother said in a provoked manner:

&emsp;&emsp;‘I am afraid that they will hurt my stomach. Offer the children some, but not too much, it would make them sick.' Then, turning toward me, she added:

&emsp;&emsp;‘As for Joseph, he doesn't need any. Boys shouldn't be spoiled.'

&emsp;&emsp;However, I remained beside my mother, finding this discrimination unjust. I watched my father as he pompously conducted my two sisters and his son-in-law toward the ragged old sailor.

&emsp;&emsp;The two ladies had just left, and my father showed my sisters how to eat them without spilling the liquor. He even tried to give them an example, and seized an oyster. He attempted to imitate the ladies, and immediately spilled all the liquid over his coat. I heard my mother mutter:

&emsp;&emsp;‘He would do far better to keep quiet.'

&emsp;&emsp;But, suddenly, my father appeared to be worried; he retreated a few steps, stared at his family gathered around the old shell opener, and quickly came toward us. He seemed very pale, with a peculiar look. In a low voice he said to my mother:

&emsp;&emsp;‘It's extraordinary how that man opening the oysters looks like Jules.'

&emsp;&emsp;Astonished, my mother asked:

&emsp;&emsp;‘What Jules?'

&emsp;&emsp;My father continued:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Why, my brother. If I did not know that he was well off in America, I should think it was he.'

&emsp;&emsp;Bewildered, my mother stammered:

&emsp;&emsp;‘You are crazy! As long as you know that it is not he, why do you say such foolish things?'

&emsp;&emsp;But my father insisted:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Go on over and see, Clarisse! I would rather have you see with your own eyes.'

&emsp;&emsp;She arose and walked to her daughters. I, too, was watching the man. He was old, dirty, wrinkled, and did not lift his eyes from his work.

&emsp;&emsp;My mother returned. I noticed that she was trembling. She exclaimed quickly:

&emsp;&emsp;‘I believe that it is he. Why don't you ask the captain? But be very careful that we don't have this rogue on our hands again!'

&emsp;&emsp;My father walked away, but I followed him. I felt strangely moved.

&emsp;&emsp;The captain, a tall, thin man, with blond whiskers, was walking along the bridge with an important air as if he were commanding the Indian mail steamer.

&emsp;&emsp;My father addressed him ceremoniously, and questioned him about his profession, adding many compliments:

&emsp;&emsp;‘What might be the importance of Jersey? What did it produce? What was the population? The customs? The nature of the soil?' etc., etc.

&emsp;&emsp;‘You have there an old shell opener who seems quite interesting. Do you know anything about him?'

&emsp;&emsp;The captain, whom this conversation began to weary, answered dryly:

&emsp;&emsp;‘He is some old French tramp whom I found last year in America, and I brought him back. It seems that he has some relatives in Havre, but that he doesn't wish to return to them because he owes them money. His name is Jules--Jules Darmanche or Darvanche or something like that. It seems that he was once rich over there, but you can see what's left of him now.'

&emsp;&emsp;My father turned ashy pale and muttered, his throat contracted, his eyes haggard.

&emsp;&emsp;‘Ah! ah! very well, very well. I'm not in the least surprised. Thank you very much, captain.'

&emsp;&emsp;He went away, and the astonished sailor watched him disappear. He returned to my mother so upset that she said to him:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Sit down; some one will notice that something is the matter.'

&emsp;&emsp;He sank down on a bench and stammered:

&emsp;&emsp;‘It's he! It's he!'

&emsp;&emsp;Then he asked:

&emsp;&emsp;‘What are we going to do?'

&emsp;&emsp;She answered quickly:

&emsp;&emsp;‘We must get the children out of the way. Since Joseph knows everything, he can go and get them. We must take good care that our son- in-law doesn't find out.'

&emsp;&emsp;My father seemed absolutely bewildered. He murmured:

&emsp;&emsp;‘What a catastrophe!'

&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly growing furious, my mother exclaimed:

&emsp;&emsp;‘I always thought that that thief never would do anything, and that he would drop down on us again! As if one could expect anything from a Davranche!'

&emsp;&emsp;My father passed his hand over his forehead, as he always did when his wife reproached him. She added:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Give Joseph some money so that he can pay for the oysters. All that it needed to cap the climax would be to be recognized by that beggar. That would be very pleasant! Let's get down to the other end of the boat, and take care that that man doesn't come near us!'

&emsp;&emsp;They gave me five francs and walked away.

&emsp;&emsp;Astonished, my sisters were awaiting their father. I said that mamma had felt a sudden attack of sea-sickness, and I asked the shell opener:

&emsp;&emsp;‘How much do we owe you, monsieur?'

&emsp;&emsp;I felt like laughing: he was my uncle! He answered:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Two francs fifty.'

&emsp;&emsp;I held out my five francs and he returned the change. I looked at his hand; it was a poor, wrinkled, sailor's hand, and I looked at his face, an unhappy old face. I said to myself:

&emsp;&emsp;‘That is my uncle, the brother of my father, my uncle!'

&emsp;&emsp;I gave him a ten-cent tip. He thanked me:

&emsp;&emsp;‘God bless you, my young sir!'

&emsp;&emsp;He spoke like a poor man receiving alms. I couldn't help thinking that he must have begged over there! My sisters looked at me, surprised at my generosity. When I returned the two francs to my father, my mother asked me in surprise:

&emsp;&emsp;‘Was there three francs' worth? That is impossible.'

&emsp;&emsp;I answered in a firm voice

&emsp;&emsp;‘I gave ten cents as a tip.'

&emsp;&emsp;My mother started, and, staring at me, she exclaimed:

&emsp;&emsp;‘You must be crazy! Give ten cents to that man, to that vagabond--'

&emsp;&emsp;She stopped at a look from my father, who was pointing at his son-in- law. Then everybody was silent.

&emsp;&emsp;Before us, on the distant horizon, a purple shadow seemed to rise out of the sea. It was Jersey.

&emsp;&emsp;As we approached the breakwater a violent desire seized me once more to see my Uncle Jules, to be near him, to say to him something consoling, something tender. But as no one was eating any more oysters, he had disappeared, having probably gone below to the dirty hold which was the home of the poor wretch.  


## 我的叔叔于勒 —— 【法】 莫泊桑  

&emsp;&emsp;一个白胡子的老头儿向我们乞求施舍。我的同伴约瑟夫·达佛朗司竟给了他一枚值五法郎的银币。我觉得有点惊奇。他于是对我说：

&emsp;&emsp;这个可怜的人使我想起一段往事，这段往事我一直念念不能忘怀。下面我就讲给您听。

&emsp;&emsp;事情是这样的：

&emsp;&emsp;我的家庭最初住在勒阿弗尔的，是一个并不富裕的人家，只能勉强糊口而已。我的父亲每天都工作到很晚才从办公室回来，但也挣不了多少钱。我还有两个姐姐。

&emsp;&emsp;我母亲因为我们生活得不宽裕很感痛苦，时常找着好些尖刻的话，好些遮遮掩掩的和不顾信义的闲话去对付我的父亲。这位可怜的丈夫当时有一个教我伤心的手势。他每每张开手掌搁在额头上，俨然是去擦汗一般，可是汗呢，并没有，而且他绝不答辩。我感到他的懦弱的痛苦了。大家尤其注意节约，从来不接受邀请去吃一顿夜饭，为的是免得回请；家里买的食品之类全是大减价的东西，种种陈货。姊姊们的裙袍全是自家缝的，为了三个铜元一公尺的滚条，也要在价格上商量好久。我们通常的食品仅仅是浓汤和牛肉杂烩。那仿佛是有益卫生的和滋补的，不过我宁愿吃旁的东西。

&emsp;&emsp;为了我失落了钮扣和撕破了裤子、他们就对我大嚷大闹。不过每逢星期日，我们就打扮得齐齐整整到港口的防波堤上去走一遭。父亲，穿上方襟大礼服，戴上丝光高帽子，套上手套，伸起胳膊给母亲挽着，母亲插戴得花花绿绿像是一艘过盛节的海船挂着各种旗子。姊姊都是早已打扮停当，专心等候出发的信号，不过，到了最后的那一刹那，总有人在家长的方襟大礼服上头发见了一处油迹，于是不得不赶忙用一块浸着汽油的破布头儿去擦掉它。

&emsp;&emsp;我父亲依旧把丝光高帽顶在头上，大礼服是脱下了的。露出两只被衬衣袖子笼着的胳膊，去等候旁人把油迹擦干净，这时候，我母亲戴好那副近光眼镜，并且脱下了那双手套，免得弄脏，忙个不住。

&emsp;&emsp;大家礼貌彬彬地上路了。姊姊们彼此挽着胳膊在前面走。她们都已到了结婚的年龄，当时父母们都要教她们在城里露露脸。我靠住母亲的左边，她的右边由父亲护卫。我现在还记得我的可怜的父母在星期日散步之中的庄严气概，他们脸上的严肃，他们态度上的正经。他们挺直了脊梁，伸直了腿子，郑重地走，仿佛一桩极端重要的事件要靠着他们的这种态度才能完成一样。

&emsp;&emsp;每逢星期日看见那些从陌生的远地方回来的大海船，父亲始终毫不变更地说着同样的话：“哈！倘若于勒就在那里面，那是何等惊人的喜事啊！”我的于勒叔，父亲的兄弟，当初全家都对他躲避不及，而那时算是家庭里的唯一希望了。我自从童年时代就听见大家谈到他，我对他是那么熟识，所以我仿佛一见面就认得出他。他在动身到美洲那天以前的一切详细情形，我统统知道，尽管大家只轻轻地谈着他人生中的那一个时期。

&emsp;&emsp;他像是曾经有过一种不良的品行，这就是说他曾经吃空了一些儿银钱。对于贫穷的家庭这就是莫大的罪状了。在富有的家庭里，一个寻快乐的人做些糊涂事情，那就被旁人在微笑之中称呼他做花花公子。在日用短缺的家庭里，若是一个孩子强迫父母消耗了本钱，必然变成一个坏蛋，一个流氓，一个无赖了！

&emsp;&emsp;即令事实是同样的，而这种分别始终算正确的，因为只有结局才能够判别行为的严重程度。

&emsp;&emsp;总而言之，于勒叔在吃光他自己那一份遗产之后，此外还大大地减少了我父亲可以得到的遗产。

&emsp;&emsp;旁人如同当年的惯例一样，教他搭上一艘从哈弗尔到纽约的商船到美洲去了。

&emsp;&emsp;一到那地方，于勒叔就做了商人，不过什么行业，我们却不知道，并且他不久曾经写信回来，说自己赚了点儿钱，希望能够补偿他从前替我父亲造成的损失。这封信在家庭里引起一种深刻的激动了。于勒叔从前有人说他毫无价值，居然一下变成了一个正派人，一个有良心的孩子，一个真正姓达佛朗司的人，纯洁正直得和所有姓达佛朗司的一样。

&emsp;&emsp;此外，一个船长从前告诉过我们，说于勒叔租了一家大店铺，并且经营一种重要的买卖。

&emsp;&emsp;两年之后，第二封信来了，他说：“我亲爱的菲利普、我写信给你是为了请你不要记挂我，我身体很好。买卖也做得不坏。明天我动身到南美洲去作一次长期旅行。将来也许有好几年没有消息给你。倘若我没有信来，你不必记挂。一到发了财，我一定回勒阿弗尔。现在希望这是一定不会等得太久，并且我们将来一定能够舒舒服服一块儿过活……”

&emsp;&emsp;这封信竟变成了家庭里的《福音书》了。大家时常读着，大家拿给所有的人看。

&emsp;&emsp;在十年当中，事实上，于勒叔再也没有消息回来了，不过时间越久，我父亲的希望就越大，后来我母亲也时常说：“将来好心眼儿的于勒回来之后，我们的情况自然不同了。那是一个很能干的人！”

&emsp;&emsp;每逢星期日，瞧着那些向天空吐出蛇一样的煤烟的黑壳子大轮船从水平线上走过来，我父亲就重述着他那句永不变动的话：

&emsp;&emsp;“哈！倘若于勒就在那里面，那是何等惊人的喜事啊！”并且大家几乎指望看见他扬起一方手帕唤着：“噢嗨！菲利普。”

&emsp;&emsp;这桩事一定会成为现实，大家盘算过无数的计划：甚至于谈到应当用叔叔的钱在安谷韦尔附近去买一所小的乡村别墅。我不能肯定我父亲对于这个题目绝没有找人商量过。

&emsp;&emsp;我的大姊当时二十八岁；另一个二十六岁。她们都还没有结婚，而这件事当时对于我们是一个忧闷。

&emsp;&emsp;终于有一个想求婚的人被介绍给二姊了。是一个机关里的职员，不是富人，然而是正派的。我素来相信于勒叔的那封信，某一天晚上我拿出来给那个青年瞧，居然使得他停止了种种游移而下决心求婚了。

&emsp;&emsp;大家连忙接受了他的要求，并且决定在举行婚礼以后，全家一同到哲尔赛岛去作一次短期的旅行。

&emsp;&emsp;对于穷人，哲尔赛岛是个旅行的理想世界。地方不远，坐着一只海船渡过海峡，就到了国外，那个小岛是归英国管的。所以一个法国人经过两小时的航海功夫，就能够看见一个邻国的民族住在他们国内的情形，并且研究一下这个被不列颠国旗覆盖的岛上的风俗，那种风俗真糟糕得如同那些说话率直的人所说的一样。

&emsp;&emsp;到哲尔岛去的那次旅行，变成了我们专心注意的事，我们唯一的期待和我们随时都怀着的梦想。

&emsp;&emsp;我们终于起程了。我现在还看得见那简直像是昨天的事：轮船在大城码头边生了火，我父亲张皇地监视着我们那三件行李上船，我母亲记挂多端，挽着我那个没有结婚的姊姊的胳膊，仿佛自从另一个姊姊嫁了之后，她就孤单得如同一只伶仃地留在原有的窝里的唯一鸡雏了；在我们的后边，才是那一对老是落在后边的新夫妇，他俩时常弄得我回转头去瞧。汽笛响了。我们都上船了，后来船离开堤岸，在一片平坦得如同翠色的大理石桌面一样的海面上走动了。我们瞧见海岸在那儿跑着，大家都幸运得并且高兴得和世界上不大旅行的人一样。

&emsp;&emsp;我父亲的大肚子，在他那件当天早上被人仔仔细细拭干净一切油迹的方襟大礼服里边挺着，而他的四周，散布着那阵在寻常出街日子必然闻得见的汽油味儿，这味儿教我认得那是星期日。

&emsp;&emsp;突然他望见了有两个男搭客正邀请两个时髦的女搭客吃牡蛎。一个衣裳褴褛的老水手，用小刀一下撬开了它的壳子交给男搭客们，他们跟着又交给那两个女搭客。她们用一阵优雅的姿态吃起来，一面用一块精美的手帕托起了牡蛎，一面又向前伸着嘴巴免得在裙袍上留下痕迹。随后她们用一个很迅速的小动作喝了牡蛎的汁子，就把壳子扔到了海面去。我父亲无疑地受到那种在一艘开动的海船上吃牡蛎的高雅行为的引诱了。他认为那是好派头，又文雅，又高尚，于是走到了我母亲和我姊姊们身边，一面问：

&emsp;&emsp;“你们可愿意我请你们吃几个牡蛎吗？”

&emsp;&emsp;我母亲因为那点儿花费，不免犹豫起来，但是我的姊姊们却立刻接受了。我母亲用一种阻挠的音调说：

&emsp;&emsp;“我害怕吃了肚子痛。你只请孩子们吃吧，不过别多吃，否则你会弄得她们生病的。”

&emsp;&emsp;随后，她又侧转来，对着我说：

&emsp;&emsp;“至于约瑟夫，他用不着吃；男孩子们，我们是不该惯他们的。”

&emsp;&emsp;这样，当时我就留在母亲身边了。认为这种区别是不公道的。我用眼光跟着我父亲，他正庄严地引着他两个女儿和一个女婿去找那个衣裳褴褛的老水手。

&emsp;&emsp;那两个女搭客刚刚走开，于是我父亲指点姊姊们应当怎样刷溜地吃，才免得教汁子撒出来；他而且竟想做出一个样子，于是就拿起了一个牡蛎来。正在模仿那两个女搭客的时候，他一下把汁水统统撒到了自己的方襟大礼服上了，接着我就听见了母亲喃喃地说：

&emsp;&emsp;“哎呀，一个人安安静静待着多好。”

&emsp;&emsp;但是我发见我父亲突然像是心绪不安，他走开了好几步，眼睛盯住了家里那几个绕着牡蛎贩子身边忙着的人，后来突然间，他对着我们走过来了。我觉得他的脸色发白，而且一双眼睛也是异样的。他低声向我母亲说：

&emsp;&emsp;“这非常古怪，那个牡蛎贩子真像于勒。”

&emsp;&emsp;我母亲发呆了，她问：

&emsp;&emsp;“哪一个于勒？”

&emsp;&emsp;我父亲接口道：

&emsp;&emsp;“就是……我的兄弟……倘若我从前不知道他在美洲有了好地位，我真会相信那就是他。”

&emsp;&emsp;我母亲慌张起来，吃着嘴说：

&emsp;&emsp;“你发痴了！你既然明明知道那不是他，为什么又说这种糊涂话？”

&emsp;&emsp;但是我父亲仍然坚持：

&emsp;&emsp;“你去看看他吧，克拉丽丝，我认为由你亲眼去证明一下要好得多。”

&emsp;&emsp;她站起来去找她两个女儿。我呢，也注视着那个人。他是老了的，脏的，满是皱纹的，他的视线没有离开他的活计。我母亲转来了，我望见她正发抖。她急速地说：

&emsp;&emsp;“我相信是他。你去向船长打听打听消息吧。要紧的是务必慎重一些，免得这坏蛋现在再落到我们身上来！”

&emsp;&emsp;我父亲走过去了，但是我跟在他后边。我觉得自己异常地激动。

&emsp;&emsp;船长，一个高个儿的绅士，瘦瘦的，蓄着一大把长髯，正用一种尊严的神气在甲板上散步，仿佛自己指挥着的是一艘开往印度的邮船。

&emsp;&emsp;我父亲彬彬有礼地走近了他的身边，一面带着颂扬的口吻向他询问有关于他的业务的事：

&emsp;&emsp;“哲西岛重要特点是哪些？它的出产？它的人口？它的习惯？它的道德观念？土壤性质等等……”

&emsp;&emsp;旁人也许相信他所问的至少是美国的事。

&emsp;&emsp;随后他们谈到了我们所搭的那艘名叫快利的船，随后又谈到了船上的人员，末了我父亲才用一道不安的声音问：

&emsp;&emsp;“这儿有一个老年的牡蛎贩子，他像是很能引人注意的。您可知道一些关于他的底细？”

&emsp;&emsp;这段谈话终于激起了船长的怒气，他冷冷地回答道：

&emsp;&emsp;“那是我去年去美洲找着的一个法国老年流浪者，我把他带回了祖国。他像是还有家族住在勒阿弗尔，不过因为他欠了他们些儿钱，所以不肯回到他们身边去。他叫于勒，姓达尔芒司或者是达尔汪司，总而言之是一个和这个差不多的姓。从前有一个短期间，他像是在国外发过财的，而现在您看得见他的破落光景了。”

&emsp;&emsp;我父亲变得面无人色了，哑着嗓，瞪着眼睛，一个字一个字慢吞吞地说：

&emsp;&emsp;“啊！啊！很好……真好……这倒不教我诧异……我非常感谢您。船长。”

&emsp;&emsp;他以后就走开了，而那位航海家莫名其妙地瞧着他走开。他重新回到我母亲跟前，面容变得非常厉害，以至于她向他说：

&emsp;&emsp;“坐下吧，有人快要看出来了。”

&emsp;&emsp;他摊开身子坐在一条长凳上，一面吃着嘴说：

&emsp;&emsp;“是他，的的确确是他。”

&emsp;&emsp;随后他又问：

&emsp;&emsp;“我们怎么办呢？”

&emsp;&emsp;她激烈地回答道：

&emsp;&emsp;“应当教孩子们走开。既然约瑟什么都知道了，就要他去找他们过来吧。尤其应当留心的，就是教我们的女婿一点也不要犯疑。”

&emsp;&emsp;我父亲像是惊呆了，喃喃地说：

&emsp;&emsp;“大祸临头了！”

&emsp;&emsp;我母亲突然变成怒气冲天的了，她接着说：

&emsp;&emsp;“我一向怀疑这个扒儿手做不成一点好事，并且有一天他又会落在我们脊梁上来的！一个姓达佛朗司的，怎能够指望在他的身上盼望一点什么！……”

&emsp;&emsp;后来，我父亲用手心抚着自己的额头，如同他素来在他妻子责备之下所做的一样。

&emsp;&emsp;她又说：

&emsp;&emsp;“拿点钱给约瑟夫，派他去付吃牡蛎的钱吧，现在，只差教我们被这花子认出来。一认出来，那船上就会有好戏瞧了。我们走到那一头去吧，并且你务须设法教那个人不至于走近我们跟前！”

&emsp;&emsp;她站起来了，他们在给了我一个五法郎的银币之后都走开了。

&emsp;&emsp;我的姊姊们正在惊讶之中等候着父亲。我说母亲觉得有点儿晕船，后来我向牡蛎贩子问：

&emsp;&emsp;“我们应当付您多少，先生？”

&emsp;&emsp;我当时简直想说：“我的叔叔。”

&emsp;&emsp;他回答道：

&emsp;&emsp;“两个半法郎。”

&emsp;&emsp;我拿出了我的五法郎的银币，他找了零钱还我。

&emsp;&emsp;我望着他的手，他那只全是皱纹的水手的脏手，又望着他的脸，一副忧愁萧索的衰老可怜的脸，一面向自己说：

&emsp;&emsp;“这是我的叔叔，父亲的兄弟，我的叔叔。”

&emsp;&emsp;我留下了半个法郎给他做小费。他向我道谢了：

&emsp;&emsp;“上帝保佑您，我尊敬的少爷！”

&emsp;&emsp;那声音正是穷人接受布施所常用的。我想他从前在美洲应当是讨过饭的！

&emsp;&emsp;姊姊们很注意地望着我，因为我的大度而感到吃惊。到了我把两个法郎交还父亲时，我母亲又吃惊了，她问道：

&emsp;&emsp;“要花到三个法郎？……这是不可能的。”

&emsp;&emsp;我用坚决的声音发言了：

&emsp;&emsp;“我给了半个法郎做小费。”

&emsp;&emsp;我母亲突然诧异得轻轻跳起来，双眼盯住了我：

&emsp;&emsp;“你发痴了，拿半个法郎给那个人，那个叫花子！……”

&emsp;&emsp;她在我父亲的一个眼色之下静止了，我父亲所示意的正是他的女婿。

&emsp;&emsp;随后大家不响了。

&emsp;&emsp;在我们眼前的水平线上，天边远处仿佛有一片紫色的阴影从海里钻出来。那就是哲尔赛岛了。

&emsp;&emsp;等到快要靠近堤岸时，我心里起了一个强烈的欲望想去再和我的于勒叔见面一次，想自己走过去，想向他说几句安慰的话，体己的话。

&emsp;&emsp;但是，当时没有一个人再要吃牡蛎了，他早已无影无踪了，无疑地，他早已走到供给这种可怜的人做住宿之所的臭气薰人的底舱去了。

&emsp;&emsp;后来我们搭了圣马洛号回来，为的是免得和他相遇。我母亲是万分不放心的。

&emsp;&emsp;从此我就永远没有再见过我父亲的兄弟了！

&emsp;&emsp;这就是你会看见我有时候拿出一块值得五法郎的银币施给流浪者的理由。
